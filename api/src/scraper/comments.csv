Not only where we harassed constantly when out visiting local areas I had a man trying to intimidate me for money. Fortunately we where able to defend ourselves. There was also a situation where a little boy kept hitting his mum in the face and no one would help not even the child's dad. It appeared that they just turn a blind eye to certain things. I would never visit again. This was about 6 years ago. The harassment was too much. Having said that we also met some really lovely people that worked on the complex, the complex being the only safe zone. Quite sad really and yet some people say they really enjoy the place and go every year. I think in today's age you really need to learn about the places you're visiting and put your safety first rather than another place to tick off the bucket list.

""Risk of Serious Injury or Death"" is appropriate.  So what's the difference?  People are used to seeing signage in places that probably have a very low risk factor -- automatic garage doors for example.  How many people are seriously injured or KILLED?  So it has become a warning taken tongue-in-cheek by most people.  On the other hand, drivers rushing to cross a railroad track as a train approaches is a counter example of high risk takers.  In this case, it has become sort of a ""tourist site"" to see a congregation of people at the St. Maartin airport.  How long has this been going on?  The government and airport authorities MUST be aware of it.  So, seriously, they can not hire a guard to command people to leave that area?  or to build a larger barricade such as made of solid concrete to deflect the air flow upward?  In fact, the authorities have accepted and therefore encouraged the practice of people coming up to the fence on a regular and constant basis.  This should make the authorities even more at fault than the tourists who probably did not think there is an actual risk of death.

It was quite a stupid decision to climb the fence, but even this is probably a common activity that generally never results in death. More of a freak accident than a definite way for someone to die. At the very most, the only changes that should be made by the airport / authorities would be to the fence design, making it more difficult for people to climb up. Barricading the area off completely and banning people from the area would be comparable to fencing off a scenic mountain path that hundreds of people like to climb and enjoy safely, but which does produce the occasional fatality when people slip. Just because this area carries a (clearly communicated) risk shouldn't be a reason for the authorities to step in and make adjustments. People take risks and are responsible for their own safety in areas like this.

Wear sunglasses, faux glasses or real glasses everywhere you go outdoors.

Not only do you protect your eyes from the harsh sun (if using polarization), but you'll at least protect your eyes from random attacks of any kind.

I was once sprayed in the eyes with a deoderant can by a so called ""friend""...I've worn sunnys ever since, and surprisingly, it's saved me from more everyday things than just random dickhead attacks.

1. Ask the person that threw acid in your face for the brand name of said acid
2. Rinse with a constant steam of 20 minutes worth of clean fresh water about 20 litres or so that you happen to have on you..
3. Apply a layer of cling film around your face so you suffocate... at least the burn will be protected...

Art is seen differently by everyone. You could look at this picture with negativity or you could look at it with an open mind.

I see flowers, a beautiful outside location and a naked body which all represent nature. She holds them both on her left (close to her heart). Her hair and makeup represent pride. She keeps her hear upright and looks into the camera as an indication of strength and confidence. Looking attractive while holding her babies could be a statement that she's still doing her thing while also loving her kids. Ok so she looks a bit like a goddess but every woman who has carried a child has an inner goddess, even if we are too insecure to see it. Life is the most beautiful gift.

Yes, it's slightly over the top but her family are known for their creativity. So why wouldn't they be dramatic & creative when announcing the most important news that they will ever have.

Look at how many haters have surfaced when she's made an effort. Imagine how many more horrible comments she would receive if she shared the average picture with tied up sicky hair, bags under her eyes and stored baby fat.

 1.China is not a Communist country and not a Capitalist contty.
2. Most Chinese don't have religion, but all 3 main religions are free willing and respected in our country(my grandmom is Buddhist, one of my relatives is in Christian and big brother of my dad is Muslim).

Go slap your face, you said we are strict controlled by goverment and brain washed, instead chinese ppl's media choice is way more open than you think. ppl who live in china can use VPN(goverment actually didn't care) and ppl like me in foriegner country ofc can use them :).

Senator Cruz has not released legislative language at this writing, just a card entitled “Path to Yes” with four proposals on it.

(1) Consumer Freedom Option.

(2) Real Flexibility for Medicaid.

(3) Enact the “consensus” market reforms.

(4) Reach a real agreement to rein in the long-term growth of Medicaid.
